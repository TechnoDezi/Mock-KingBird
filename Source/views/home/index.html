    Welcome to Mock-KingBird.<br />
    <br />
    This tool can be used to create a proxy for JSON api's and record traffic for later playback.<br />
    You can also build new mocked api endpoints on top of your recordings or completely from scratch its up to you.<br />
    All recorded traffic can be edited or modified in order to successfully mock your endpoints.
